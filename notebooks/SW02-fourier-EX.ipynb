    "$$ x(t) \\approx A_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^N \\left(A_k\\cos(\\omega_k t + \\varphi_k) \\right)$$\n",

    "This decomposition allows us to analyze a signal in terms of its frequency components, which is fundamental in many applications, such as spectral filtering, image compression, and solving partial differential equations.\n",

    "Note that, in addition to the Fourier series, there are other types of series expansions. In a *Taylor series*, the basis functions are polynomials of increasing order. In a *wavelet series*, the basis functions are wavelets—special functions that are localized in both time and frequency. What this means in practice, we will explore later in the course.\n",

    "## **&#9734;  Exercise 5 – Fourier spectrum using FFT**\n",
    "\n",
    "A little preview: We can compute discrete Fourier transforms for (almost) any discrete signal using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. We will explore this in more detail in upcoming lectures, but for now, we will already use it in the context of Fourier series.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Instructions**\n",
    "- First: Skim through [the Scipy tutorial on FFTs](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/fft.html). Do you understand the main differences to Fourier series?\n",
    "- Create a composite signal with the following characteristics:\n",
    "  - (At least) three harmonic components with frequencies (10, 100, 200)Hz\n",
    "  - Amplitudes (2, 1.5, 3)\n",
    "  - with a DC component of amplitude = 2\n",
    "- Use a sampling frequency of $f_s=1$ kHz to construct the signal\n",
    "- Compute the Fourier spectrum of this composite signal. Here is the procedure:\n",
    "    1. Compute the `fft` by passing the signal: `X = fft(x)`  \n",
    "      This creates the discrete Fourier transform $X[k] = \\mathcal{F}(x(t)$)\n",
    "    2. Compute the corresponding frequencies $\\omega_k$ using `freqs = fftfreq(N, 1/fs)`.  \n",
    "    We need to specify the number of samples $N$, and the sampling period $\\Delta t = 1/f_s$.\n",
    "    3. For practical reasons, the frequencies are sorted slightly awkwardly. Calling `fftshift()` on both the Fourier transform `X` and the frequencies `freqs`, fixes this.\n",
    "- Visualize the Fourier spectrum\n",
    "    - Plot the full (symmetric) spectrum, ensuring the frequency and amplitude axes are correctly labeled.\n",
    "    - Separate amplitude and phase plots to analyze signal properties.\n",
    "- Advanced task: \n",
    "    - Add random noise with an amplitude of 0.5 to the composite signal.\n",
    "    - Compute and visualize the Fourier spectrum of the noisy signal.\n",
    "    - Display only the positive frequencies (use rfftfreq() for this).\n",
    "    - Compare and discuss the differences in the spectra before and after adding noise.\n"
