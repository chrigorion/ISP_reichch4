    "In the previous lecture, we extended the concept of the Fourier series to the Fourier transform. Similar to the Fourier series, the Fourier transform is a mathematical tool that allows us to represent a function in terms of its frequency components. However, in contrast to the Fourier series, the Fourier transform results in a **continuous function in frequency**, and can be applied to a much wider class of aperiodic signals $x(t) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier transform and its inverse are defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "X(\\omega) &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x(t) \\cdot e^{-i\\omega t} dt\\\\\n",
    "x(t) &= \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} X(\\omega) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t} d\\omega\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x(t)$ is the input signal, $X(\\omega)$ is the Fourier transform of the signal, and $\\omega$ is the angular frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture, we focused on the **continuous-time** Fourier transform. However, in practice, we usually work with discrete-time signals. The **discrete-time** Fourier transform (DTFT) is the discrete counterpart of the continuous-time Fourier transform. \n",
    "\n",
    "For practical use, we often need a version of the Fourier transform that applies to discrete-time signals. This version is called the **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**. The DFT and its inverse are defined as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "Where $x[n]$ is the discrete-time input signal, $X[k]$ is the DFT of the signal, and $N$ is the number of samples in the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFT allows us to analyze the frequency content of discrete-time signals with a **finite number of samples**. We can think of the DFT as a sampled version of the continuous-time Fourier transform. Although its derivation is somewhat complex, as it requires sampling in both the time and frequency domains, the DFT retains many key properties of the continuous-time Fourier transform. Specifically, the DFT is linear, satisfies the convolution theorem, and preserves the symmetry properties of the Fourier transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** is a highly efficient algorithm to compute the DFT $X[k]$ of a discrete signal $x[n]$ with a finite number of samples. Conversely, we can use the **inverse FFT (IFFT)** to reconstruct the original signal (or an approximation) from its frequency-domain representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\***Technical Note:** Different FFT implementations may compute the DFT up to a constant factor. Scipy’s FFT implementation uses an \"energy-preserving\" FFT that grows with the number of samples. To compute the magnitude of the FFT, we must divide the result by the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will use the FFT to analyze the frequency content of a signal, explore some of its properties, and filter the signal by zeroing some of its frequency components in the frequency domain. Then, we will reconstruct the signal using the inverse FFT.\n",
